        <div class="paragraphone"><strong>Backstreet Boys</strong> (often abbreviated as BSB) are an American vocal group consisting of
            Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, and cousins Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson. The group was formed
            in 1993 in Orlando, Florida.


        </div>


        <div class="paragraphtwo"> The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996).
            In the following year,
            they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S.
            debut album, Backstreet Boys (1997), which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to
            superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000).
            They also released a greatest hits album, The Hits - Chapter One (2001), with a new single, "Drowning".
            After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the
            conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group
            then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009). </div>


        <div class="paragraphthree"> Richardson permanently rejoined the group in 2012. In the following year, they
            celebrated their 20th
            anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This. Their follow-up album DNA
            (2019) debuted at number one, more than two decades after the group formed, and 19 years after they last
            topped in 2000. They also became the first boy band to top the U.S. album charts in three different decades.
            The Backstreet Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band of
            all time, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Led Zeppelin to
            have their first ten albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. The
            albums Backstreet Boys and Millennium were both certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of
            America (RIAA), making them one of the few bands to have multiple diamond albums.
            The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013. They also released their first
            documentary movie, titled Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of in January 2015. In March 2017, the
            group began a residency in Las Vegas that lasted two years, titled Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.

                <h1>Smells Like Teen Spirit</h1>

                <div class="paragraphone">"Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a song by the American rock band <strong>Nirvana</strong> It is
                    the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC
                    Records. The unexpected success of the song propelled Nevermind to the top of several albums charts
                    at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point when grunge entered the mainstream.
                    "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was Nirvana's biggest hit, charting high on music industry charts around
                    the world in 1991 and 1992; it topped the charts in Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. It
                    garnered critical acclaim and topped the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll. The song was dubbed
                    an "anthem for apathetic kids" of Generation X, but Nirvana grew uncomfortable with the attention it
                    brought them. In the years since Kurt Cobainâ€™s death, listeners and critics have continued to praise
                    "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as one of the greatest songs of all time.


                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraphtwo"> The music video for the song is based on the concept of a high school pep rally
                which ends in chaos
                and riot, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film Over the Edge and the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll
                High School. It won two MTV Video Music Awards, and was in heavy rotation on music television. In
                subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's programming department, claimed the video "changed
                the entire look of MTV" by giving the channel "a whole new generation to sell to". In 2000, the
                Guinness World Records named "Smells Like Teen Spirit" the "Most Played Video" on MTV Europe.
                "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of The Songs That
                Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) ranked the song
                at number 80 on their Songs of the Century list. In 2002, NME ranked the song the number two on its
                list of "100 Greatest Singles of All Time", while Kerrang! ranked it at number one on its list of
                the "100 Greatest Singles of All Time". In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
                fifth on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy
                Hall of Fame.</div>
