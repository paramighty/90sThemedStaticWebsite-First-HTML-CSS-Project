        <div class="paragraphone">Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring their
            mascot, Mario. Alternatively
            called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of the
            greater
            Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game
            console. There are more than 20 games in the series. </div>


        <div class="paragraphtwo"> The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom,
            typically with Mario as the
            player character. He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and often by other members of the
            Mario
            cast. As platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and
            atop
            enemies in themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the
            kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super
            Mario
            Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core
            gameplay concepts and elements. These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the
            character
            special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing. </div>


        <div class="paragraphthree"> The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which
            includes other video game genres and media such as film, television,
            printed media, and merchandise. More than 380 million copies of Super Mario games have been sold
            worldwide, making it the fifth-best selling video game series, behind the larger Mario franchise,
            the
            puzzle series Tetris, the series Pokémon video games, and first-person shooter series Call of Duty.

            <div class="paragraphone">Street Fighter, commonly abbreviated as SF or スト (Suto), is a Japanese media
                franchise centred on a series of fighting video and arcade games developed and published by Capcom. The
                first game in the series was released in 1987, followed by six other main series games, various
                spin-offs and crossovers, and numerous appearances in other media. Its best-selling 1991 release Street
                Fighter II established many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre.
